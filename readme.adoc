# TODO - LAPTOS

## Introduction

This is a simple Todo app, as POC for an Leptos (WASM) application. It contains some basic elements, including a popup window.

As bonus, I used Tailwind to prettify the application. Trunk includes the Tailwind engine, so no need to install the JS or Standalone version.

## Tools

- https://www.rust-lang.org/ (nightly build)

- https://trunkrs.dev/

## Commands

Start the service with live reload for development:

```
trunk serve --open --port=8080
```

Build a release candidate (artifacts in /dist)

```
trunk build --release
```

## Running application

The application is deployed on https://oxide-byte.github.io/todo-laptos/[GitHub Pages].
